# Open-Pyrojet
A hardware and documentation repository for the development of the Open Pyrojet 3D printer project. Essentially a crossbred between inkjet and flame spray, enabling, scalably rapid, high resolution, multimaterial, heterogenous 3D printing with closed loop control on the consumer desktop.
