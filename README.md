# Open-Pyrojet
A hardware, software, electronics and documentation repository for the development of the Open Pyrojet 3D printer project. Essentially a crossbreed between inkjet and flame spray. This machine will enable, scalably rapid, high resolution, multimaterial, heterogenous 3D printing with closed loop control on the consumer desktop.
